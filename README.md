Timer
=====

Just like your kitchen timer, but on your computer!

It has up and down arrows to set the number of hours, minutes, and seconds to be counted down.

It will also count up if you press start when the timer value is zero.

The application supports the system tray, has timer expiration pop-ups, and a quick menu to set common count-down values.

Multiple instances of the application can be run, each with a different name. This can be useful if you want to track time spent on different projects.

This is a Qt application. To build it, you'll need Qt and a C++ compiler.

Build Instructions:
	Run qmake then run make (or nmake for Visual Studio)
